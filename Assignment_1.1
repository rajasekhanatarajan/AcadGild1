2)What is Recycling of elements in a vector? 
When applying an operation to two vectors that requires them to be the same length, R automatically recycles, 
or repeats, elements of the shorter one, until it is long enough to match the longer Vector. 

3)Give an example of recycling of elements.
Example:
Suppose we have two Vectors c(1,2,4) , c(6,0,9,10,13), where the first one is shorter with only 3 elements. Now if we sum these two, we will get a warning message as follows.
> c(1,2,4) + c(6,0,9,10,13)
[1]  7  2 13 11 15
Warning message:
In c(1, 2, 4) + c(6, 0, 9, 10, 13) :  longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length
